 1. Create a test that checks if the Class Utils contains folllowing URL:
 “http://localhost:8080/login"

 2. Check if the port is at "8080"

 3. Check if the protocol of parsed URL is "http:"

 4. Check if the the given Query is an Object 

 5. Test if URL is being parsed with an expected Query:
 “http://localhost:8080/login?user=user&password=pass”
    
    --> Create an Object that contains user and password

    --> Test if parsed Query is equal to expected Query (Use "toEqual" here because it is an Object is not a primitive type, therefore toBe will not work)
    
    --> Test if
